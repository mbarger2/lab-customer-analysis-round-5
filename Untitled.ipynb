    "Some datasets have values that are missing, invalid, or otherwise difficult for an algorithm to process. If data is missing, the algorithm can’t use it. If data is invalid, the algorithm produces less accurate or even misleading outcomes. Some datasets are relatively clean but need to be shaped (e.g., aggregated or pivoted) and many datasets are just lacking useful business context (e.g., poorly defined ID values), hence the need for feature enrichment. Good data preparation produces clean and well-curated data which leads to more practical, accurate model outcomes.\n",
